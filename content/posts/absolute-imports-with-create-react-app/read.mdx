title: Absolute imports with Create React App

The default way of importing files or modules which are not from `node_modules` is the usage of <b>Relative Imports</b>.

Take for example we have a directory structure like this.

```
|-- public
|-- src
|  |-- components
|  |  |--PictureComponent
|  |-- pages
|  |   |-- MainPage
|  |--index.js
|-- package.json
|-- package-lock.json
```

We need to import the `PictureComponent` in our `MainPage`.

```js
//example of a relative import
import PictureComponent from "../components/PictureComponent";
```

This is totally fine, until your project becomes very large and some files are several levels deep. It becomes harder to import and trace
files and modules from other directories in the project.

```jsx
// imagine having to import a file like this
import CustomHeader from "../../../../../compoents/CustomHeader";
```

### Using Absolute Imports

Absolute imports helps with importing files from a common source. In most cases, most files you would need would be in your source (`src`) directory.
With Absolute Imports, you can write your file paths, already assuming you are at the `src` directory.

```js
// example of an absolute import
import PictureComponent from "components/PictureComponent";
```

This import will work from any `js` or `jsx` file, no matter where they are in the project directory. To set this up create a file called `jsconfig.json` in
the project root folder. And add the configuration below. If you are using typescript, you should add the configuration to your `tsconfig.json`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  }
}
```

This will help VSCode and other IDE to resolve path in TypeScript & JavaScript and ofcourse, if there are cases where you need to still use a relative import if it's more
sensible, it will still work.
