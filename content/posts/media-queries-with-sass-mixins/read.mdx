title: Media Queries with SASS mixins

Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet.They make it easy to
avoid using non-semantic classes like .float-left, and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.
Mixins are defined using the `@mixin` at-rule, which is written `@mixin <name> { ... }` or `@mixin name(<arguments...>) { ... }`.
They can be used to encapsulate styles that can be dropped into a single style rule; they can contain style rules of their own
that can be nested in other rules or included at the top level of the stylesheet; or they can just serve to modify variables.

Mixins are included into the current context using the `@include` at-rule, which is written `@include <name>` or `@include <name>(<arguments...>)`,
with the name of the mixin being included.

### Example with no arguments

```scss

// Style in Scss

@mixin styled-text {
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.article {
  @include center-text;
  .header {
    @include center-text;
  }
}

```

```css
// Resulting css

.article {
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.article .header {
  text-align: center;
  font-weight: 500;
}

```

### Example with arguments

```scss
// Style in Scss

@mixin size($width: 50px, $height: 50px) {
  width: $width;
  height: $height;
}

.box {
  @include size(100px, 100px);
}

.bigger-box {
  @include size(400px, 300px);
}
```

```css
// Resulting css

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.bigger-box {
  width: 400px;
  height: 300px;
}
```

Mixins can be really cool. They can be taken advantage to make writing of Media queries across your app easier.
Media queries can be alot, especially when trying to write queries for different devices and screen sizes.
I will show you how to make this a bit easier with mixins. Take this example below.

```scss
.box {
  width: 400px;
}

.special-box {
  color: red;
}

@media (max-width: 720px) {
  .box {
    width: 100px;
  }
  .special-box {
    color: blue;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1440px) {
  .box {
    width: 500px;
  }
}

```

This might not look so bad, but can become a pain as your styles become larger. It becomes less easy to relate selectors with thier corresponding
styles on in a media query, or the queries can be written under or with each style to improve readability. A mixin can be used to make this easier.

```scss
@mixin mobile {
  @media (max-width: 720px) {
    @content;
  }
}

@mixin desktop {
  @media (min-width: 1440px) {
    @content;
  }
}

.box {
  width: 400px;
  @include mobile {
    width: 100px;
  }
  @include desktop {
    width: 500px;
  }
}

.bigger-box {
  color: red;
  @include desktop {
    color: blue;
  }
}

```

This helps to improve readability and also writing as the media query is now some sort of short hand.

### Note

This might not be ideal if you want to seperate your media queries to different files to maybe to load them on different screen sizes.

#### Example

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-device-width: 800px)" href="800.css" />
```

But it is possible to find a work around which will still involve using mixins.
